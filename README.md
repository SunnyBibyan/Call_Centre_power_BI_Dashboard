## Key Features
- **Data Sources**: The analysis uses a dataset from a call centre with information on calls, agent performance, and customer feedback.
- **Visualizations**: Includes various charts and graphs to track metrics like call volume, agent efficiency, and customer satisfaction trends.
- **Metrics**: Focuses on average handling time, call resolution rates, and customer feedback ratings.
- **Actionable Insights**: Offers recommendations to improve agent training and optimize call handling times.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**: Used for building the interactive dashboard.
- **Excel**: For initial data preprocessing and cleaning.
- **Dataset**: Provided as an Excel file (`01 Call-Center-Dataset.xlsx`).

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains the following key columns:
- **Call ID**: Unique identifier for each call.
- **Agent ID**: Identifier for the agent handling the call.
- **Call Duration**: Time spent on each call.
- **Customer Satisfaction Rating**: Customer feedback score.
- **Resolution Status**: Whether the call issue was resolved.

## Visualizations
Here are some of the key visualizations included in the dashboard:
- **Call Volume Over Time**: Line chart showing trends in call volume across different time periods.
- **Agent Performance**: Bar chart comparing agents based on key metrics like call resolution and handling time.
- **Customer Satisfaction Trends**: Pie and bar charts showing customer feedback and satisfaction rates.
- **Average Handling Time**: A detailed view of the average call handling time by different agents or departments.

## Project Structure

## How to Use the Project
1. **Download the `.pbix` file** and open it in Power BI.
2. **View the Dashboard**: Explore interactive visualizations to get insights into call centre performance.
3. **Adjust filters**: Use Power BIâ€™s filtering features to focus on specific time periods, agents, or call types.

## Insights and Recommendations
- **Improve Agent Training**: Certain agents have higher resolution times. Targeted training can improve efficiency.
- **Enhance Customer Satisfaction**: Calls with longer durations often result in lower customer satisfaction scores. Consider revising call scripts or support protocols to improve these interactions.
- **Optimize Call Handling**: Calls with lower resolution rates should be reviewed to find common issues that might require process changes.
